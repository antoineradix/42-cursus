# What is 42?

42 is a private, non-profit and tuition-free engineering and programming school based on peer-to-peer learning and hands-on projects. It offers a flexible 3-5 years self-paced and tuition-free curriculum.

42's educational model is qualified as innovative and is unlike any other program: no teachers, courses or classes, no tuition, no fees and no grades required to enter the school. The only admission requirements are to be 18+ years old and then to complete the entrance examination: 'la Piscine'.

A Piscine (that means 'swimming pool' in French) is a 4-week intensive and immersive coding bootcamp, 7 days a week. No previous programming experience required. 900 applicants learn C programming and bash scripting through daily exercises. Selected candidates (appr. 250 for Paris and until 2018 since the process changed in 2019) can register to be full-time students at 42, a tuition-free engineering school.

# The Norm

(If you are wondering why we don't use many built-in functions and for loops)

[The Norm](https://github.com/42Paris/norminette) is 42 style guideline and apply for all programs written in C. A single Norm Error leads to the grade of 0/100.
* forbidden functions: almost all the Standard C Library functions except read, open, write, malloc and free for some projects
* 25 lines per function maximum (without external brackets) and 84 characters per line maximum
* no more than 5 functions in a .c file and no more than 5 variables per function, no comments within a function's body
* for loops are forbidden
and so forth...
