### Introduction
C programming can be very tedious when one doesnâ€™t have access to those highly useful
standard functions. This project gives you the opportunity to re-write those functions,
understand them, and learn to use them. This library will help you for all your future C
projects.
Through this project, we also give you the opportunity to expand the list of functions
with your own. Take the time to expand yourlibftthroughout the year.

### How do I use the library?

1. Clone this repo and cd into it:
 
        git clone https://github.com/antoineradix/42-cursus.git
        cd 42-cursus/1-libft

2. Run Make so you can build the library:

        make

3. Compile your project with the library _(dont forget to include ``libft.h`` in your project)_:

        gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -I [libft_path] [your_file.c] [libft_path/libft.a]
